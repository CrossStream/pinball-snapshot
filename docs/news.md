And what wouldn't be a better way to celebrate than for Phil Coval

Anniversary?

It is now close to ten years since the project started.
Some of the tags in the older source files dates back to January 2000.
That's a loooong time ago.

Time flies when you're having fun.
My system back then was an AMD 500Mhz with a Voodoo3 card and a 15" CRT monitor,
nowadays it is a MacBook 13". Still, nothing has really changed.
y BMI is the same, HTML is still written with Emacs in a shell, for-loops are unrolled,
the internet is slow and my car can't fly ;).

Merry Christmas to everyone and Game On!
