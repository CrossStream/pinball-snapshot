# Building your own tables #

Those who want to build their own tables can download the in-house table editor for the game.
It is basically a simple 3D-modeller which allows you to edit the statemachines of objects.
Currently it uses its own file format but support for importing other 3D file formats is on its way.
The editor only works on linux and other QT 3.x.x friendly environments.
Download it as a seperate package from sourceforge, pinedit.
The editor requies that the latest version of pinball is installed.
