# Bugs #

If I am not aware of the bugs I can not fix 'em.
The list of known bugs is at project page:

- <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=43821&atid=437484>

Submit bugs there or send them to henqvist at users.sourceforge.net,
please put the word 'pinball' somewhere in the subject
otherwise it may go in the thrash as spam (99% of the english mail I get is spam).
