# Download #

Download the latest release,
0.3.0 from the files sections at the project page at sourceforge.

The rpm packages are for Red Hat 8.0.
There is also some Mandrake binares on rpmfind
and Debian package are also available from www.debian.org
in the testing distribution (although they are really old at the moment).

These packages are updated by other people
so it may take some days (weeks) before the latest release is available.
