pinball (0.3.1-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload.
  * New upstream version (Closes: #172599) which starts on alpha
    (Closes: #230053) and fixes menu display (Closes: #212219).
  * Now includes man page (Closes: #230741).
  * Recompiled with gcc 3.3 (Closes: #210505).
  * Removed "The" and "." in short description to make linda/lintian happy.
  * There are now two tables/levels. Updated the description.
  * Support noopt for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS and make "-g" the default.
  * Compile with -mieee on alpha, so it now runs on this platform as well.
    This Closes: #175896.
  * Create highscore-directories in /var/games/pinball; this does not work
    yet, unfortunately.
  * Removed the .ex-files in the debian/-directory, Closes: FIXME.
  * There are now binary dependent libs for each table which are therefore
    in pinball, so that pinball-data remains arch=all. This is an intrim
    solution, which should be fixed on the next upload by either integrating
    the tables into the main packages, or switching the -data package into
    arch=any.
