Installing and building
=======================

It is best to remove any previous version of pinball before installing a new 
version. If you have used a rpm-package write as root user 'rpm -e pinball'. 
If you have installed from source code goto the pinball source directory and 
write as root user 'make uninstall'.

After checking that you have the necessary libraries installed you are ready
to install. If you have an rpm-package you write as root user 
'rpm -i pinball-x.x.x.rpm'.

If you compile from a source package check that you also have the have the 
development libraries installed. They usually have a name like 
sdl-devel.x.x.x.rpm. Then install with the usual:

configure
make 
make install (as root user)

or if you want to build a software version (Allegro)

configure --with-allegro
make
make install (as root user)

The game is startet with 'pinball'.
